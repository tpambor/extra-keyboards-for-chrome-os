# German E1/E2 Keyboard Layout for Chrome OS

## Overview

This extension makes available the german E1/E2 keyboard layouts on Chrome OS.

## Installation

For most users, this extension should be installed through Chrome Web Store.
Please refer to the instructions found in the [repository's
README.md](https://github.com/google/extra-keyboards-for-chrome-os/blob/master/README.md)
for more information on how to add a keyboard layout to Chrome OS.

For development purposes, you can install this extension directly as well. The
above-mentioned
[README.md](https://github.com/google/extra-keyboards-for-chrome-os/blob/master/README.md)
has information on that as well.

## Technical Details

This extension builds on the keyboard layouts contained in `xkeyboard-config`,
i.e., it only makes available the german E1/E2 keyboard layouts that are already
installed through Chrome OS. As a consequence, this extension can't influence
any specifics of the layout such as key mappings.
